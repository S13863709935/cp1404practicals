1. What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
90%
2. What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
Time: Before class and after class
Location: Home 
Duration: 1 hour/video + 30 mins coding practice
3. What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
Daily practice of function refactoring.
Organize knowledge points with mind maps for clear logical memory.
4. What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
Stop: Testing code insufficiently or not at all before committing.
Change: Implement thorough testing (e.g., edge cases, invalid inputs) using PyCharm's testing tools before every commit to ensure code reliability.
5. What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
What's done poorly:
I frequently neglect to write test cases for functions, particularly for edge cases such as invalid inputs.
Improvement plan:
I will adopt testing frameworks like pytest to systematically create test cases for every function. 
6. What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
Programming code conventions (e.g., function design, commenting).
